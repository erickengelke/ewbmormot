# ewbmormot
Elevate Web Builder interface to Mormot

This is based on the EWB/mormot projects in my Enterprise Delphi Databases 2nd Edition book (c) 2017 Erick Engelke
which retails for $59.95 USD on Amazon, or $30 for Ebook directly from me (http://www.erickengelke.com)

While the book is copyrighted, the source code is Apache licensed which is quite free for you to use in your 
own works whether they are open or closed source, free or commercial without royalties.  I just request that
you buy one of my books or eBooks to help fund the project.

The code is used in production servers using Delphi.  I am presently merging in code for NewPascal Windows support
which requires a few $IFDEF changes to one file.

At some point I (or some wonderful volunteer) will add Linux support with NewPascal.
